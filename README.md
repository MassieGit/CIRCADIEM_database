# CIRCADIEM_database
Python script that imports REDCAP exports into a relational SQL database

# Instructions
This script is used by exporting the latest REDCAP database in a single csv with labels from CIRCADIEM_Hospital and CIRCADIEM_FU.
The location of these two files are to be updated in the first chunk of code (CIRCADIEM Hospital and CIRCADIEM FollowUp).
The script will work if a local version of mySQL is installed and the sql details are updated.
